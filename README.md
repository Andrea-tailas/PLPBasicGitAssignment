    \`\`\`

2. **Create a New File**:
    - Create a new file named \`hello.txt\` in your project directory with the following content:
    \`\`\`text
    - Document the steps and commands used in a text file or in the README of your repository.
    
    - If you encounter issues, refer to the GitHub documentation or seek assistance from peers or the instructor.
    \`\`\`
    - You can create the file using a text editor or by running the following command in your terminal:
    \`\`\`bash
    echo \"- Document the steps and commands used in a text file or in the README of your repository.\n\n- If you encounter issues, refer to the GitHub documentation or seek assistance from peers or the instructor.\" > hello.txt
    \`\`\`

3. **Stage the File**:
    - Add the newly created file to the staging area by running the following command:

    \`\`\`bash
    git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
    \`\`\`
    - Push the committed changes to the remote repository by running the following command:
